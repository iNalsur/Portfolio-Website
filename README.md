# iNalsur | Portfolio Website

<h2>Introduction</h2>
This is the site you are currently on, for me it was the first project where I used JavaScript, Node.js, Git, GitHub and Bash. During the studying, I had to make a portfolio project and use in it all the skills that I learned during the studying.

<h2>Tools</h2>
While working, I used the MacOs system, wrote code in the Visual Studio Code program. The programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript were used in this project. For processing photos and pictures I used Photshop program. In this project, I used the Bash console, in it I used Git to make commits, Node.js to check the work of JavaScript codes, and also to publish the site on GitHub. And used Google Chrome Dev Tools, to test the site's performance.

<h2>Process</h2>

To begin with, I drew wireframes, this wasn't hard for me, because for many months I have been imagining what my portfolio site would look like.

The site was made with a simple scheme, first I assembled the bones, added style to them, then added movement to the site using CSS and JavaScript, and at the end proceeded to adjust/corrections.

The site is made simply, it consists of one page, the page has a sections of navigation and content. The site consists of 4 sectors, about me, projects, blog and contacts. At the very beginning, the sector “about” is activated, if the user moves to another sector, then the activated sector disappears, this was done using the JavaScript [onclick] method. In different sectors there are buttons that redirect to other sectors, there are buttons that direct to other sites (social media, projects) and a button through which you can send an email to the site owner. When clicking on a project in the blog sector, a back button will appear that will be glued to the user's screen so that the user can return to the blog sector anywhere on the screen. The site has a different look, when the screen is compressed, for example, when compressing in which the words in the navigator no longer fit, the words disappear and a navigation button appears, it is glued to the screen position, when you click on it, a menu will open where you can find buttons with special sectors. The menu is closed if the user presses the button to close the menu or if the user enters another sector. The [.getElementById] functions were used for the buttons and the [onclick] activator was used to make them work. Also in the projects menu, if the user swipes over the project logo, the logo will be replaced by another logo with changed colours, this was also done using [.getElementById] and the activator [onmouseover, onmouseout].

A lot of different things have also been added to the head, for example, when sharing a site on a smartphone, the link will have important fact-finding information like a photo, a mini-text about the company. Also, the site has a theme color and an icon working on the iOS platform, etc.

At the end, the site was published on GitHub, you can see the website on the <a href="https://inalsur.github.io" target="_blank">link</a>.

<h2>Outcome</h2>

I was very satisfied with the site, it turned out to be the way I imagined it, I got a lot of experience and continued my education.
